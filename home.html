     The Nissan GT-R (Japanese: 日産・GT-R, Nissan GT-R), is a sports car and grand tourer produced by Nissan, 
     unveiled in 2007.[3][4][5] It is the successor to the Nissan Skyline GT-R, a high-performance variant of the Nissan Skyline. 
     Although this model was the sixth-generation to bear the GT-R name, it is no longer part of the Skyline line-up. The GT-R is 
     built on the PM platform, which is derived from the FM platform used in the Skyline and the Nissan Z models.
     After more than six years of development, the production version of the GT-R was unveiled at the 2007 Tokyo Motor Show and 
     featured the VR38DETT engine and other new technologies.

            The Toyota Supra (Japanese: トヨタ・スープラ, Hepburn: Toyota Sūpura) is a sports car and grand tourer manufactured by the Toyota Motor
            Corporation beginning in 1978. The name "supra" is derived from the Latin prefix, meaning "above", "to surpass" or "go beyond".[3]
            The initial four generations of the Supra were produced from 1978 to 2002. The fifth generation has been produced since March 2019 
            and went on sale in May 2019.[4] The styling of the original Supra was derived from the Toyota Celica, but it was both longer and wider.
            [5] Starting in mid-1986, the A70 Supra became a separate model from the Celica. In turn, Toyota also stopped using the prefix Celica and
            named the car Supra.[6] Owing to the similarity and past of the Celica's name, it is frequently mistaken for the Supra, and vice versa. 
            The first, second and third generations of the Supra were assembled at the Tahara plant in Tahara, Aichi, while the fourth generation was
            assembled at the Motomachi plant in Toyota City.</p>

        <h1 class="carsName" id="car3Name">Renault KWID</h1>
        <p class="carPara" id="car3Para">
            The Kwid was developed under the project code BBA. It is the first car to be based on the new CMF-A platform jointly developed by Renault and Nissan.
            [4] It is slightly longer but narrower than Renault's smallest conventional vehicle, the Twingo[5] with a high sitting position and a 180 mm (7.1 in) ride height.
            The car was designed by an engineers' team settled in India led by Gérard Detourbet, a senior engineer, former mathematician described as "an innovation a minute"
            who led the development team for the first-generation Dacia Logan.[7]
            The Kwid was unveiled at Chennai on 20 May 2015 by Renault's CEO Carlos Ghosn.[5] Ghosn said the car would be "a game changer for Renault in India.
            " The car has 98 per cent of parts localisation and extensive engineering by local Renault's personnel.[8][9] The Kwid is aimed at competing with other 
            small cars within the Indian market, as the Suzuki Alto,[4] and incorporates uncommon equipment for its segment such as a digital instrument cluster and 
            a multimedia touchscreen.
            In September 2015, the Kwid was launched in India at a starting price of 257,000 rupees,[10] equal to $3,884. Sales started in September and had a
             "flying start" of 25,000 bookings in 2 weeks and 50,000 in 5 weeks,[11][12] then 70,000 in 2 months, getting 10% of effective market shares in its 
             segment.[13][14] The Indian version is exported to various overseas markets such as Sri Lanka, Indonesia, Tunisia and Sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
